        question: "How does data ingestion work?",
        answer: "Maple measures ingestion by the volume of data you send — logs, traces, and metrics are each measured in gigabytes. Each plan includes a monthly data allowance per signal type. Check the plans above for exact limits."
    },
    {
        question: "What happens if I exceed my plan limits?",
        answer: "We'll notify you as you approach your limits. On the free plan, ingestion pauses once you hit the cap. On paid plans, additional usage is billed at transparent per-GB rates with no surprises."
    },
    {
        question: "How long is data retained?",
        answer: "Retention varies by plan — the Starter plan includes 14-day retention, Startup includes 30 days, and Enterprise plans offer custom retention periods. All plans include full query access to your retained data."
    },
    {
        question: "Is Maple compatible with OpenTelemetry?",
        answer: "Yes — Maple is built natively on OpenTelemetry. Any application instrumented with OTel SDKs or the OTel Collector can send data directly to Maple with zero code changes. No proprietary agents required."
    },
    {
        question: "Can I self-host Maple?",
        answer: "Absolutely. Maple is fully open source and can be self-hosted on your own infrastructure. The cloud plan is available for teams that prefer a managed experience."
    },
    {
        question: "Do you offer a free trial for paid plans?",
        answer: "Yes, paid plans include a 30-day free trial so you can explore all features before committing."
