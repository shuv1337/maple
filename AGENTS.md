## External Effect Reference

- When implementing or refactoring Effect code in this repository, use these as reference:
  - `/Users/maki/Documents/superwall/app` — reference implementation for Effect patterns (HTTP middleware, services, layers)
  - `/Users/maki/Documents/superwall/app/.context/effect` — Effect source code
- Treat those references as read-only context and adapt patterns to Maple's existing architecture.
